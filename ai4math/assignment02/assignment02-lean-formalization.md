## Task

Use an agentic coding assistant — such as Claude, Codex, opencode, or openclaw — to
obtain, set up, and drive a **Lean proving agent** that formalizes a mathematical
theorem in **Lean 4 with Mathlib**, iterating until the **Lean kernel** accepts the
proof with **no `sorry`** and no errors.

You **drive the agent with natural-language prompts**; the agent sets up the Lean
project, writes the Lean code, and checks it against the kernel. You do not need to
write the proof tactics by hand.

**Recommended:** formalize the theorem you proved in **Assignment 1** (your
`blueprint.md`). You already have a complete, human-readable natural-language proof;
Assignment 2 turns that same proof into a machine-checked Lean proof. You may instead
choose another precise theorem if you prefer, subject to the same standard below.

## Lean proving agents

Suitable Lean agent systems include **numina-lean-agent** and **Archon**. Both launch a
coding agent (Claude Code) in a loop that writes Lean and verifies it with the Lean
kernel through `lean-lsp-mcp`. These harnesses are **agent-agnostic**: because they
drive a coding assistant, they are easy to repoint at another agent (Codex, opencode,
…). You may use any Lean proving agent you can install and run; part of the task is
using a coding assistant to figure out the setup.

Worked examples from class (Euler's partition theorem, formalized two ways, with
in-browser Lean links):

- https://math-xmum.github.io/ai4math/numina/ (Numina) ·
  https://math-xmum.github.io/ai4math/rethlas-archon/ (Archon)
- https://math-xmum.github.io/ai4math/euler-lean/ (the Lean proofs + live editor)

## What "done" means

- A Lean 4 file (or a small `lake` project) that **compiles against Mathlib with no
  errors and no `sorry`**.
- The formal **statement faithfully matches your theorem**. State it honestly: a
  machine-checked proof of a weakened or trivially-true restatement earns little
  credit.
- `#print axioms <your_theorem>` shows only the standard axioms (some subset of
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) — in particular **no `sorryAx`** and no
  custom `axiom`.
- *Optional bonus:* keep the definitions **computable** (definitions reduce under
  `#eval`), and note if you obtain a choice-free proof (`#print axioms` =
  `[propext, Quot.sound]`).

## Required submission files

Email these two files to `hoxide@gmail.com` (zip a multi-file project if needed):

- `Formalization.lean` — your Lean formalization (sorry-free, compiles against
  Mathlib). If you used a multi-file `lake` project, attach a `.zip` of the project (or
  the main files).
- `report.pdf` (about 2–4 pages) containing:
  - the theorem, stated both **informally** and as the **Lean `theorem`**;
  - which Lean agent/system you used and **how you drove it — include the actual
    natural-language prompts you gave**;
  - a short account of the run: how many rounds/iterations, what the agent did, and
    where you had to steer, constrain, or repair it;
  - the final **`#print axioms`** output for your main theorem;
  - a brief reflection: what the agent formalized well, what was hard, and what you
    learned about autoformalization.
- *Optional:* the agent's config / prompt files, or a shareable link to your proof
  (e.g. a `live.lean-lang.org` link).

## Expected workflow

1. Choose your theorem — recommended: your Assignment 1 result. Write a clean,
   self-contained statement (all definitions and hypotheses included).
2. Use a coding assistant to obtain, inspect, and set up a Lean proving agent: a Lean 4
   + Mathlib project and the agent's loop.
3. Seed the Lean **statement** (with `sorry`) and drive the agent to fill in the proof.
   Verify after each step with the Lean kernel (`lean_diagnostic_messages` /
   `lake env lean`), not by eye.
4. Iterate until the file is sorry-free and error-free; then check `#print axioms`.
5. Write the report.

Email exactly your Lean file(s) and `report.pdf` (plus any optional config/links) to
`hoxide@gmail.com`.
